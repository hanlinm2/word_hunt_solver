Word Hunt Solver helps player get the longest words in the popular iMessage Game Pigeon game Word Hunt.

To find the longest words, the program uses a recurisive backtracking algorithm to find all possible letter paths and uses binary search to check if the letter path is a word in the list.

Note:
This is still a work in progress. This project uses an new and experiemntal front end tool called Pyscript, so things might break.
