This is a project I am doing to learn web development while following tutorials from [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css).

I  learned how to use the Dev tools in browsers to inspect elements and use HTML and CSS to position and style different the elements.

The final project result is linked here: [Google Homepagee](http://hanlinm2.github.io/google-homepage)
